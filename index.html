  <h3>This is the test file for geogory's simple-server!</h3>
  <p>this server is a minimlist http server written in rust I plan on making this a fully fledged server that is snappy
    and minimal.</p>
  <br>
  <p> I plan on also adding http support and maybe ftp I'm unsure for the time being</p>
  <p>Right now the server doesn't even have the ability to send images to requests and their isn't a presistant
    connection but I will work out those things soon.</p>
  <p>this is hopefully a project I will stick to and finish and make it whole and complete</p>
