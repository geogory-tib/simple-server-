This is a simple http server I am writting to learn the http protocol and web programming. I plan on using no frameworks and nothing but the rust stdlib so I can learn these things at a low level.    
The server in its current state is rather barren at the moment but I am working on making it a useable lightweight minimlist server for small applications with small userbases   
              *I.e small static sites with maybe a couple hundred concurrent users*   
Currently the server can only send text based documents at the current moment but I am working adding support for binary data like images and other files    
Features I plan on adding in the future
- HTTPS
- Richer Configuration options
- FTP?
