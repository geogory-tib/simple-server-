# simple-server 
### A hobby project by Geogory Tibisov under GPL v 3.0

This is a simple multi-threaded http server I am writting to learn the http protocol and web programming. I plan on using no frameworks and nothing but the rust stdlib so I can learn these things at a low level.    
The server in its current state is rather barren at the moment but I am working on making it a useable lightweight minimlist server for small applications with small userbases   
              *I.e small static sites with maybe a couple hundred concurrent users*     
Features I plan on adding in the future
- HTTPS
- Richer Configuration options
- FTP?
